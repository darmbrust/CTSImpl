CTS Reference Implementation Changelog
*****************************
Release 1.2.11	11/18/05    *
*****************************
* Fixed a case senstive issue when running on DB2 (sql and sqllite), trying to map an id to a name.
* Fixed a array out of bounds exception that could happen if supported code systems are missing.
* Updating the LexGrid converter libraries for the new LexGrid SQL Schema.  The SQL table changes 
   do not affect CTS.

*****************************
Release 1.2.10	10/17/05     *
*****************************
* New Lucene index format - now one index for regular and norm searching (instead of two)

* Lucene searches now support a "sounds like" algorithm for matching - double metaphone, to be
  specific.  
  
* Changed the setup/configuration loading methods - now supports loading properties configuration 
  files from the classpath - and has a cleaner API.
  
* Added new simpler methods for constructing the implementations.
  
* Made the system cache consistant - and size configurable in the properties file.

* Changed the index structure on the SQL tables - changed the variable order of the SQL queries to match
  (helps performance on SQL dbs with poor optimizers)


*****************************
Release 1.2.9	9/29/05     *
*****************************
* Removed all uses of "Select count(*) > 0 as foo" since it is not supported by DB2

* Fixed DB2 support.

* Updated the GenericSQLConverter code for DB2 issues, consistency.

* Fixed a bug in the LDAP VAPI implementation that was causing it to miss certain relationships
  on a lookupCompleteCoded concept call.

* Query updates for SQLLite to fix DB2 issues, and give performance improvements.

* Overhauled the JUnit test system - now the JUnit tests populate the databases with the necessary
  data prior to the test run, and it is completely dynamic WRT which databases it will test against, 
  and what tests it will run

* Removed the MSAccess LexGrid/LexGrid Lite Rim database - replaced with a HypersonicSQL database.

* Removed the mysql/posgres Rim database dumps - replaced with a LexGrid XML file which can be loaded
  into your database of choice.
  
* Updated structure of shipped libraries, removed unnecessary libraries, files, etc.


*****************************

*****************************
Release 1.2.7	6/23/05     *
*****************************
* Upgraded to 1.2.1 release of apache axis - this caused some of the public API classes to change a bit.
Most notably, all of the ArrayOf___ classes went away.

* Fixed a bug in sql lookupCompleteCoded concept that caused it to not return the proper error message - 
instead it was just not returning relationships in certain cases.

* Fixed a bug in both sql implememntations where lookupProperties would fail if you passed in an empty (vs 
null) properties array.

* Added code stubs for the CodeMappingOperations service (not yet implemented)

and moved into the CTSUtility package now.

* Updated CTSUtility code - smarter properties file locating, and other code reorganization.

* Fixed a bug in SQL and SQLLite that was causing it to return the "@" node as a valid relationship (it
shouldn't ever return those)

* Updated the spec wording to correspond to the changes made in release 1.2.6 - see below.

* Changed the default properties file name, changed the default LOG4J config parameter inside of the properties
file.  * OLD PROPERTIES FILES WILL NEED MODIFYING*

*****************************
Release 1.2.6	5/25/05     *
*****************************
* Changed lookupDesignation (in all implementations) so that it does not require a language be 
provided.  Now uses the default language if no language is provided.  This is not in the spec 
(yet) and it mentioned in bug #260.

* Changed the implementation of lookupCodeSystemInfo, such that in the array of languages returned,
the first language is now the "defaultLanguage" for the code system.  This is not in the spec (yet)
and it is mentioned in bug #260.

* fixed a bug in lookupDesignation (all implementations) where it was failing to return the correct
designation if no preferred designation was specified in the data

* Changed the way the sizeLimits were handled in lookupConceptCodesByDesignation and 
lookupConceptCodesByProperty in all implementations - previously, wild card searches were likely 
to return less than the requested limit.

* Fixed bugs where it wasn't matching on language subtypes where it should (ldap and sql vapi impl)

* Fixed the problems dealing with mapping codingSchemeNames back to oids in relationships - all sql and 
  ldap implementations.
  
* First working release of new JUnit Tests

* Updated some relationship code to be faster, better take advantage of default indexes.


*****************************
Release 1.2.4	4/13/05     *
*****************************

* Fixed a bug in the id to name mapping in sqllite

* Fixed (another) boolean related bug with querying boolean columns on the access sql 
database.

* Fixed issues with isActive on a conceptCode in sqlLite

* made sqlLite calls by codingSchemeId match the localname or the registered name

* updated code to make it automatically reconnect failed SQL connections.

* fixed a bug in the objectCaching on SQL - it wasn't using a unique object cache per connection.

* fixed more bugs with sqlLite and booleans

* made SQL and LDAP implementations deal with missing localNames

* made it not fail out on lookupCompleteCodedConcept if there is no native relationship

*****************************
Release 1.2.2	1/27/05     *
*****************************

** VAPI Implementations *****************************
Fixed it so that lookupCodeExpansion can be given a null or blank language.  It now uses the default
language in this case.

Moved the test classes to their own package(s), simplified them.

Had to change the VapiExpansionContext format, to add a sourceCodingSchemeId.  Ldap implementations 
needed this.
 
Moved the sql packages to sqlLite - to make room for the new sql implementation - the one that uses the
full model representation of the database instead of the "lite" database.

** VAPI LDAP Implementation *****************************
Fixed the associationQualifier code (this was broken from a recent ldap schema change)

Fixed some mistakes that discovered in the handling of sourceCodingSchemes and targetCodingSchemes in 
code expansions.

** VAPI SQL Implementation *******************************
Added this new implementation that runs against sql (as opposed to sqlLite)

** VAPI SQL Lite Implementation **************************
Fixed some issues dealing with targetCodingScheme in lookupCompleteCodedConcept, and code expansions.

fix for above improved performance of code expansions.

fix for getNameForCodeSystemId where it wasn't populating the object cache.

** MAPI LDAP implementations *******************************
moved the test classes to their own package, simplified them.


*****************************
Release 1.2.1	1/05/05     *
*****************************
** VAPI LDAP Implemntation **

** VAPI SQL Implementation **

*********** MAPI ************

*********** Other ***********
* Upgraded to 1.2RC2 of Apache Axis.  Changed the wsdl generation type from the default to "WRAPPED" 
to allow interoperability of SOAP services with .NET.  This changed what the resulting generated 
code looks like, so all of the implementation code was modified as necessary to work again.  Main 
change was that now instead of returning Arrays of things, there are new classes generated - for 
example - ArrayOf_xsd_String.

* Updated the build file a bit, for the above changes, and to reduce some of the duplicate work that was
done in the generation of CTS withVarNames.

* Updated the jar file of CTSUtility - it had to be updated for changes from above.

* The build file was not putting the wsdl files into the cts spec web directory or zip file.  Fixed now.



**************************
Release 1.2	12/17/04 *
**************************
* VAPI LDAP Implemntation *
* Made fixes as necessary to line up with the new 2.0 LexGrid Model (the new model required some ldap schema 
changes.  Primarily, searches with a filter of objectClass=textualPresentation would no longer work.

* MAPI *
* Made changes sync up with revision 1.2 of the CTS spec.


* Other *
* Added LexGrid Service Index support to all of the constructors
* Moved the Utility stuff to a seperate package/project (now in the CTSUtility.jar file, with source available
as a seperate download)
* Renamed/moved CTS constants to be more senseable
* Changed XML parsing from AdHoc to JDOM throughout
* Fixed the build process on Linux - spec had case sensitivity problems

* Added more power to the ldap dn string escape utility method.
* Started initial work on Lucene indexing of content (not finished yet)
* Fixed the version numbers that the methods return.
